CakePHP Sample App on OpenShift
===============================

This is a quickstart CakePHP application for OpenShift v3 that you can use as a starting point to develop your own application and deploy it on an [OpenShift](https://github.com/openshift/origin) cluster.

My nephew and I edited this to use for a school project :)
